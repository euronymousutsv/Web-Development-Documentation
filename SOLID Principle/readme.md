# Solid Principle 
    1. SRP : Split responsibilities into seperate classes
    2. OCP : Extend classes without modifying them.
    3. LSP : Ensure subclasses can replace parent classes without errors
    4. ISP : Break large interfaces into smaller ones based on client needs
    5. DIP : Inject dependencies to avoid hard coupling between classes.
